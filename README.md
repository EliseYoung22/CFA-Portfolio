# Structure 
 This portfolio was created in Ruby on Rails with a touch of Javascript. There are a number of styling pages that correlate with various HTML components. I used bootstrap to help develop my navigation bar which I installed additionally. 
 
 ## Design Process
 The first thing I did for my design process was make a [Pinterest] (https://au.pinterest.com/eliseyoung_4/portfolio/) board for inspiration with various different images, colours and website examples. From this board I #chose my favourite elements and started to sketch out how I wanted my site to look. My actual site is quite different from the one  I sketched as I changed my ideas along the way. Some of the main design features I wanted to have on my portfolio were soft colours, cartoon style features and have it as a one page design with all the elements centered. Here are some the wireframes I sketched:
